### 2. using gist-run to experiment with Aurelia components and report problems
<br>

By adding support to use the [GistRun tool](), this catalog application provide the ability to run each example of each Aurelia Kendui bridge component - as illustrated on this following image

Click on the `RUN` button will result with this same example "Area charts: multi axis" running in a new window, completely isolated from the Catalog application:

#### 2.1 Experimentation

It should be pretty obvious that running any of the samples from this Components catalog applications **as a gist** you get a very dramatic increase of your ability to check this sample's behavior. You can change any part of JavaScript code (in a meaningful way preferrably) in the view model, or any attributes in the view -- and get nearly instant (1 - 2 seconds) response from the GistRun.

#### 2.2 Report a problem to Aurelia-UI-Toolkist team

In order to ensure complete context of your problem and get the fastest possible response, please create an issue **[here](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-bridge/issues)**, then create a clone (fork) of **[this gist](https://gist.github.com/adriatic/c6a05892747c35d643ac4833af411117)**
